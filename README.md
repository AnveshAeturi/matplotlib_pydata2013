This repository contains notebooks and code snippets for the advanced
matplotlib tutorial at PyData 2013
(see the schedule [here](http://pydata.org/sv2013/schedule/))

This tutorial will focus on interactive aspects of matplotlib: how keyboard
callbacks, mouse callbacks, and widgets can be used to interact visually
with data.

Towards the end, we'll take a look at some more complicated examples of
interaction in matplotlib.  Several of the examples will be drawn from
recent posts on my blog, [Pythonic Perambulations](http://jakevdp.github.com).
